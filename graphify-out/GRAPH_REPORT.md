# Graph Report - Base-Project  (2026-10-01)

## Corpus Check
- 68 files · ~81,530 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.
- Unclassified: 2 file(s) not represented in the graph (top: (none) 2)

## Summary
- 830 nodes · 781 edges · 62 communities (51 shown, 11 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 99% EXTRACTED · 1% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS · INFERRED: 6 edges (avg confidence: 0.9)
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `bb116396`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Knowledge Gaps
- **616 isolated node(s):** `idea-refine.sh script`, `vscode`, `fs`, `path`, `name` (+611 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 678 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **11 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `Security and Hardening` connect `Hardening Controls` to `Hardening Patterns`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.002) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **What connects `idea-refine.sh script`, `vscode`, `fs` to the rest of the system?**
  _616 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
- **Should `Git Workflow and Versioning` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.05180388529139685 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Code Review and Quality` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.06666666666666667 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Test-Driven Development` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.06666666666666667 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Context Engineering` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.06896551724137931 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
